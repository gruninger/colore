Eliminating L_5/1

============================== end predicate elimination =============

Term ordering decisions:
Predicate symbol precedence:  predicate_order([ =, point, T, line, overlaps, part, O, in, ppart ]).
Function symbol precedence:  function_order([ c1, c2, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f4, f7, f13, f1, f5, f6, f14, f15 ]).
After inverse_order:  (no changes).
Unfolding symbols: (none).

Auto_inference settings:
  % set(paramodulation).  % (positive equality literals)
  % set(binary_resolution).  % (non-Horn)

Auto_process settings:
  % set(factor).  % (non-Horn)
  % set(unit_deletion).  % (non-Horn)
