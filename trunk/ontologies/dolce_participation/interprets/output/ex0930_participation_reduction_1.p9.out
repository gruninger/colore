Predicate symbol precedence:  predicate_order([ =, point1, point2, point3, line1, line2, line3, plane1, plane2, T, ED, PD, overlaps, part1, part2, part3, in1, in2, in3, ppart, tin1, tin2 ]).
Function symbol precedence:  function_order([ c1, c2, c3, f1, f5, f6, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f18, f22, f23, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f35, f36, f41, f42, f43, f44, f45, f2, f3, f4, f7, f15, f19, f20, f21, f24, f32, f37, f40, f46, f8, f9, f16, f17, f25, f26, f33, f34, f38, f39, f47, f48 ]).
After inverse_order:  (no changes).
Unfolding symbols: (none).

Auto_inference settings:
  % set(paramodulation).  % (positive equality literals)
  % set(binary_resolution).  % (non-Horn)

Auto_process settings:
  % set(factor).  % (non-Horn)
  % set(unit_deletion).  % (non-Horn)
