Function symbol precedence:  function_order([ c1, c2, c3, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f10, f11, f20, f21, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f36, f1, f7, f12, f22, f25, f31, f8, f9, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f23, f24, f32, f33, f34, f35 ]).
After inverse_order:  (no changes).
Unfolding symbols: (none).

Auto_inference settings:
  % set(paramodulation).  % (positive equality literals)
  % set(binary_resolution).  % (non-Horn)

Auto_process settings:
  % set(factor).  % (non-Horn)
  % set(unit_deletion).  % (non-Horn)
