Users of the COLORE system fall into one of three general categories: Administrators, Members and Non-Members.  Administrators are authorized to perform all functions relating to both the COLORE system and content management.  Members are associated with specific ontologies defined within the repository and have management control over the accessibility and content of these ontologies.  Non-Members are not formally registered with the COLORE system and only have access to information that has been made public by Administrators and Members.

Members associated with a the COLORE system fall into one of four categories: 1) Ontology Owners, Ontology Committers, Ontology Contributors and non-members.
