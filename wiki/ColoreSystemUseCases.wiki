#summary This page provides a listing of Use Cases for the COLORE System.
=== By Cameron Ross ====

= Objectives =

The COLORE initiative has requirements related to both content development and software development.  The Uses Cases presented here describe COLORE's functional software requirements.  However, before delving into a detailed analysis of software requirements, it is important to understand the overall objectives of the project.  COLORE is intended to be an open repository of ontologies represented using Common Logic (CL).  The objectives of the COLORE project are:
 # to develop techniques for representing ontologies using CL,
 # to establish an open repository of CL-based ontologies,
 # to provide a testbed for investigating ontology integration and evaluation techniques,
 # to support the design and reuse of modular ontologies,
 # to promote [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c039175_ISO_IEC_24707_2007%28E%29.zip ISO 24707] for representing knowledge using first-order logic (i.e. CL),
 # to develop and promote best practices for ontological engineering using CL,
 # to construct software infrastructure to support collaborative ontology development using CL,
 # to provide programmatic services for accessing the contents of a CL repository,
 # to enable the proliferation, and subsequent integration of additional CL-based repositories, and
 # to enable and promote an ecosystem of both open source and commercial developments focused on CL technology.

= System Architecture =

The [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/samian-platform/ Samian Platform] is being developed under an affiliate open source project to support the construction of semantic systems based on Common Logic.  The Samian Platform is an open source project released under a license that promotes inclusion with both open source and commercial systems (i.e. [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html EPL 1.0]).  COLORE employs the Samian Platform as the CL support kernel within the system.  This supports item #10 of the COLORE objects.  The figure illustrates the architecture of the Samian Platform.  The Common Logic Abstract Syntax (CLAS) shown in the figure provides an Object-Oriented rendering of CL texts.  The Samian Platform provides an extensible mechanism for iterating over CLAS instances to perform custom operations (e.g. language transformations).

= Actors =

Users of the COLORE system fall into one of three general categories: _Administrators_, _Users_ and _Guests_.  _Administrators_ are authorized to perform all functions relating to both system management and content management.  The COLORE system may have one or more _Administrators_.  _Users_ are formally registered with the COLORE system and may create projects and become _Project Members_.  The COLORE system may have any number of _Users_.  _Guests_ are not registered with the COLORE system and are limited to read-only access of COLORE's public artifacts.

_Users_ fall into one of three sub-categories: _Owners_, _Committers_, and _Contributors_.  _Owners_ may make changes to the project's artifacts and may add and remove _Users_.  A project may have one or more _Owners_.  _Committers_ may make changes to the project's artifacts, but may not change the project's members list.  A project may have zero or more _Committers_.    _Contributors_ have read-only access rights to a project's artifacts, but may participate in the discussion forums and wikis associated with the project.

To summarize, The list of COLORE actors is:
 * _Administrator_
 * _User_
 * _Guest_
 * _Owner_
 * _Committer_
 * _Contributor_

= COLORE Use Cases =
The methodology used to analyze COLORE requirements is motivated by the concepts of Resource-Oriented Architecture, developed by [http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260 Richardson & Ruby], and the ideas on Resource-Oriented Analysis & Design, developed by [http://www.manning.com/louvel Louvel & Boileau]. The format used to capture COLORE Use Cases is based on [http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Effective-Cases-Alistair-Cockburn/dp/0201702258 Alistar Cockburn's] approach.
