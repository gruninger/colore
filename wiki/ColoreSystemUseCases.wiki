== COLORE Actors ==

Users of the COLORE system fall into one of three general categories: _Administrators_, _Members_ and _Non-Members_.  _Administrators_ are authorized to perform all functions relating to both system management and content management.  COLORE can have one or more _Administrators_.  _Members_ are associated with specific ontologies defined within the repository and have management control over the accessibility and content of these ontologies.  _Non-Members_ are not formally registered with the COLORE system and only have access to information that has been made public by _Administrators_ and _Members_.

Project _Members_ fall into one of three sub-categories of COLORE users: _Owners_, _Committers_, and _Contributors_.  _Owners_ can make changes to the artifacts of a project and can change the accessibility rights of other users with respect to the project.  A project has one or more _Owners_.  _Committers_ can make changes to the content of an ontology, but may not change the accessibility rights of the project.  A project has zero or more _Committers_.    _Contributors_ have read-only access rights to the artifacts of the project, but may participate in any discussion forums and wikis associated with the project.
