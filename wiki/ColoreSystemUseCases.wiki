#summary This page provides a listing of Use Cases for the COLORE System.
=== By Cameron Ross ====

= Objectives =

The COLORE initiative has requirements related to both content development and software development.  The Uses Cases presented here describe COLORE's functional software requirements.  However, before delving into a detailed analysis of software requirements, it is important to understand the overall objectives of the project.  COLORE is intended to be an open repository of ontologies represented using Common Logic (CL).  The objectives of the COLORE project are:
 # to develop techniques for representing ontologies using CL,
 # to establish an open repository of CL-based ontologies,
 # to provide a testbed for investigating ontology integration and evaluation techniques,
 # to support the design and reuse of modular ontologies,
 # to promote [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c039175_ISO_IEC_24707_2007%28E%29.zip ISO 24707] for representing knowledge using first-order logic (i.e. CL),
 # to develop and promote best practices for ontological engineering using CL,
 # to construct software infrastructure to support collaborative ontology development using CL,
 # to provide programmatic services for accessing the contents of a CL repository,
 # to support both web-based and non-web-based applications,
 # to enable the proliferation and interoperation of CL-based repositories, and
 # to enable and promote an ecosystem of both open source and commercial developments focused on CL technology.

= System Architecture =

The Samian Platform, being developed under an affiliate [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/samian-platform/ open source project], will support the construction of semantic systems based on Common Logic.  The platform is released under the [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html Eclipse Public License] which supports COLORE's objectives for ecosystem development.  The Samian Platform is being adopted as COLORE's CL processing kernel.  Figure 1 depicts the Samian Platform within the context of the COLORE system architecture.  The Common Logic Abstract Syntax (CLAS) shown in the figure provides an Object-Oriented representation of arbitrary CL texts.  The platform provides an extensible mechanism for iterating over CLAS instances to perform a variety of custom operations such as language translation and metrics analysis.  This same mechanism will also be used to integrate the CLAS model with various reasoning engines.  The CLAS model may be persisted to a variety of database back-ends via the [http://www.datanucleus.org/ DataNucleus Access Platform].  The versatility of this persistence technology will help remove barriers to adopting the Samian Platform within a variety of applications.

The Resource-Oriented Repository (ROR) shown in Figure 1 provides a resource-centric interface into the Object-Oriented CLAS model.  We believe that REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an effective method for interfacing with the contents of a repository.  However, unlike most popular applications of REST, which target web services, the Samian ROR is generalized to support both web-based and non-web-based applications,  This appears to be a unique feature of the Samian Platform which supports COLORE's objectives.

= Actors =

Users of the COLORE system fall into one of three general categories: _Administrators_, _Users_ and _Guests_.  _Administrators_ are authorized to perform all functions relating to both system management and content management.  The COLORE system may have one or more _Administrators_.  _Users_ are formally registered with the COLORE system and may create projects and become _Project Members_.  The COLORE system may have any number of _Users_.  _Guests_ are not registered with the COLORE system and are limited to read-only access of COLORE's public artifacts.

_Users_ fall into one of three sub-categories: _Owners_, _Committers_, and _Contributors_.  _Owners_ may make changes to the project's artifacts and may add and remove _Users_.  A project may have one or more _Owners_.  _Committers_ may make changes to the project's artifacts, but may not change the project's members list.  A project may have zero or more _Committers_.    _Contributors_ have read-only access rights to a project's artifacts, but may participate in the discussion forums and wikis associated with the project.

To summarize, the list of COLORE actors is:
 * _Administrator_
 * _User_
 * _Guest_
 * _Owner_
 * _Committer_
 * _Contributor_

= COLORE Use Cases =
The methodology used to analyze COLORE requirements is motivated by the concepts of Resource-Oriented Architecture, developed by [http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260 Richardson & Ruby], and the ideas on Resource-Oriented Analysis & Design, developed by [http://www.manning.com/louvel Louvel & Boileau]. The format used to capture COLORE Use Cases is based on [http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Effective-Cases-Alistair-Cockburn/dp/0201702258 Alistar Cockburn's] approach.
